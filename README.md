#AngularJS Animation Demo

This repo is a demonstration of animating between views using ngView (a directive in module ng). This repo is based on the demo found here: http://code.angularjs.org/1.1.4/docs/api/ng.directive:ngView

Unfortunately, as of 08/15/2013 there are some errors in the demo on the Angular website. This version corrects those mistakes.

Get started by cloning into the repo:

```shell
$ cd your-dev-folder
$ git clone https://github.com/cweems/AngularJS-Animation-Demo.git
```

After cloning the repo, do this to start a node server so that you can view your edits in the browser:

```shell
$ cd AngularJs-Animation–Demo
$ node ./scripts/web-server.js
```

Navigate your browser to localhost:8000/index.html

Note that you'll need to have node installed.
